- Now, before clicking into the "Explore the data in the ABC Atlas" section take a moment to follow the [link](https://alleninstitute.github.io/abc_atlas_access/intro.html) that provide more information on the composition and methods to accessing datasets. By following said link you can access a very complete documentation on the data available on the website and Allen Institute servers.

- Once you have explored datasets documentation, enjoy the interactive experience on the [online data visualizer](https://knowledge.brain-map.org/data/LVDBJAW8BI5YSS1QUBG/explore).

- Play changing the parameters for visualization on the tool bar at the left of the screen, however if this is confusing for you, you might want to take a look on the [General User Guide](https://community.brain-map.org/t/introducing-the-allen-brain-cell-atlas/2444)

- The web interface, however amazing and very useful, it can be either too simple or too complicated when we are trying to explore very specific data, and it can result more easy to deal if we download only the specific data that we need.
